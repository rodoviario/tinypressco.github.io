It's been eight months since the first version of Tinypress. The primary objective has been to make blogging on Github [pages] easier by providing a simple interface to conceal the geeky setups and processes. And the service has developed to provide more features like email-to-post, auto-save (private drafts), post preview, amongst other things. 

But there is more that can be done - mobile clients, more themes, theme switching, importing blogs from other sites, social sharing and more. To keep the development work going and the servers running, Tinypress will now be paid. **For only $9.99/year**. That's less than $1 a month. Existing users can continue using it for free for the next 3 months. New users will get a month free trial. 

I hope you continue to enjoy the product. If you have questions or feedback, kindly send a mail to [love@tinypress.co](mailto:love@tinypress.co) or get in touch on Twitter via [@tinypressco](http://twitter.com/tinypressco).
